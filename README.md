# What is this?
Tiny Android app that inserts a single row into an existing database in Notion. This project uses a [Java implementation of the Notion API.

# Why this app?
I keep my todo items in Notion and I needed a way to quickly capture a todo item. Unfortunatly, on my phone, starting the official Notion app takes a long time, and the same is true for using Notion in Chrome. This was a good reason to check out the Notion API and write a tiny app that does this one thing really well.

# Requirements
This app is only useful for people who want to change the source code and adapt it to their needs. This app mostly exists to show how to use a subset of the Notion API on Android. This means that the requirements for using this app are that you can compile and install your own Android app.
